## Problem Description

Develop a secure web-based Budget approval platform, to simplify the process of requesting, and approving funds for the purpose of purchasing new equipment, and resources every year. This platform should allow employees to log requests for new equipment and resources to the line manager, the line manager should be able to approve or reject these requests based on justification and budget before sending them to the heads of department. The heads of department can then send these final requests to the finance department to await approval. The ability to grant and revoke permissions from a high level should also be catered for. This process should be wrapped in a robust security architecture that takes the most important security requirements into consideration, while also protecting against the various potential attacks that could occur during daily usage
